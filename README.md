Check out the repository on GitHub to get started.
-Project B - Project B is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft that adds static typing to JavaScript. It is designed to make large-scale JavaScript applications more manageable and easier to maintain by catching errors at compile-time rather than at runtime. It also offers features such as classes, interfaces, and decorators, which are not available in JavaScript.
-Project C - Project C is a web application that uses Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to create a form for collecting user data. The application allows users to enter their personal information and submit the form, which is then stored in a MongoDB database. Basic validation is included to ensure that the required fields are filled in before submitting the form.
